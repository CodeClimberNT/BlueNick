# Welcome â†’ [Wiki Easy Access](wiki)

This site was originally made for building an easy wiki to store all solutions for my frequent problems, but now it is much more! Feel free to explore and find if anything interest you!

## About the site

This site was made using the amazing [Hextra](https://github.com/imfing/hextra) theme.

In the top right corner you can find the major categories of this site. For now only the [wiki](wiki) works, but the plan is to populate all the remaining fields with their respective content.

## A Note About Ads

If you find ads on this site and they annoy you, you are more than free to turn on any adblocker you may prefer! The only motivation of ads is to keep this site running, and I hope to have set everything right to have minimally invasive ones (Hopefully only anchor at the bottom of the screen that you can easily remove). If the ads are, or will be, too aggressive, **PLEASE** [let me know!](https://github.com/CodeClimberNT/HowTo/issues)
