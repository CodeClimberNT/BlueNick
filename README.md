# HowTo [Home üè°](https://github.com/CodeClimberNT/HowTo/wiki)

I always find myself in need to that particular fix that drive me crazy for days, and when that fix is found the work needed was so small that it just made no sense to have spent days on end to find it and worse of all: when something make the problem reapper month after and the journey to find that single line to paste into the terminal restart.

And so now I make my duty to document each solution I find for my problems whenever I encounter them so that:
1. I will not suffer anymore to find for the 4th time the same fix
2. You will not suffer searching it for the first time
